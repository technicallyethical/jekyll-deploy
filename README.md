## Jekyll 4 build and deploy action

This is a github action for building and deploying Jekyll 4 content. 

### Why?

I wanted to use some themes and gems not supported in the typical github pages jekyll instance. 

### Prior work

This repo is based on [this repo](https://github.com/joshlarsen/jekyll4-deploy-gh-pages). I didn't create this as a fork, because fork permissions sometimes get [weird](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility)
